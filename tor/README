If you want to run server.py as a hidden service and connect your
instance of smmpchat.py to it via tor, the following suggestions
may be helpful:

1) Edit server.py to make sure it binds to localhost only

     HOST = 'localhost'

2) On the server machine, set up a hidden service to listen to
   the port specified in server.py (50000 is the default).

3) On the server machine start tor and server.py

4) On each of the client machines, run the socat.sh script that
   is available in this directory. This will proxy all packets
   sent on the local port through tor to port 50000 on the tor
   hidden service server. Change SMMP_SERVER_PORT in the socat
   script if you change the server.py port.

5) On the client machine start tor.

6) On the client machine start smmpchat.py. HOST should be localhost
   and port should be the local port you specified in the socat
   script.

Enjoy!
